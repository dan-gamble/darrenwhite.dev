# NVM - setting the default version

For easy switching between node versions I use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager). However, after a few years, it would default to version 12.

To move to a more recent LTS version run the following command:

```bash
nvm alias default 14.14.0
```

Change the version to whichever you'd prefer to default to.
